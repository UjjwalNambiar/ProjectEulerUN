/*
Project Euler: Problem 6: Sum square difference
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.

*/

/*SOLUTION:
Create function sumOfSquares that returns the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.
Create function sum_of_n that returns the sum of the first n natural numbers.
In sumSquareDifference(n):
  - Initialize square_of_sum as the square of sum_of_n(n).
  - Initalize sum_of_squares as sumOfSquares(n).
  - Initalize diff as square_of_sum - sum_of_squares.
  - Return diff.
*/


function sumOfSquares(n) {
  var sum = 0;

  for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += (i * i);
  }

  return sum;
}

function sum_of_n(n) {
  var sum = 0;

  for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }

  return sum;
}

function sumSquareDifference(n) {
  var square_of_sum = sum_of_n(n)**2;
  var sum_of_squares = sumOfSquares(n);
  var diff = square_of_sum - sum_of_squares;
  
  return diff;
}


//TESTS
